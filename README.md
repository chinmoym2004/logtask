## LogMyTask


### Goal is not to come out from terminal and text editor ( to log my task ) while writing code.

```
It a python program . A fun project for terminal lover.

You can log your task details like "Serial No","Task Name","Time Taken","Status","Note","Log Time"

It create a csv for you in this format , like <client_name>_<month>_<year> and log all your task for the month. 


I created this to help myself . If you find its fun you can contribute to make it better.

```

####Next update I would like to have a conf file to keep multiple client name( as i work for multiple project ) so that you don't need to change client name in main code file etc. also let see how can we make it more handy.


```

NOTE : Sync your genrated file with gdrive or dropbox that way you can easily share those with ur client . 

```

Thanks for stopping by
